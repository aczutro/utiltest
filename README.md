# utiltest
Python library for the test of command line utilities

## Description

This Python module provides a `TestBench` class suitable for testing command
line utilities.

A test bench object is provided with a command line to be executed and,
optionally, with the data to be passed to the application under test (AUT) if
the AUT reads its input from STDIN.  The test bench is also provided with the
expected output and error messages, as well as the exit code that the AUT is
expected to return.  The test bench executes the provided command line and
compares all data generated by the AUT to the expected data in order to decide
whether the AUT has passed the test.

A test bench object can be reused for multiple tests.  The TestBench class
provides an interface that makes it easy to modify the command line for further
tests.

## Installation and use.

Open your Python interpreter and read the contents of the sys.path variable:

```python
>>> import sys
>>> sys.path
['', '/usr/lib/python2.7', '/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0']
```

Then, simply copy the provided file `utiltest.py` to any of the directories in
the list.  Alternatively, copy the file to any directory of your choice and add
that directory to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`.  The next time you
open the Python interpreter, the new directory should be included in the
`sys.path` variable.  Then you'll be ready to go.

Add the line `import utiltest` to your Python application in order to use the
`TestBench` class defined in the module.  Get more info with `help(utiltest)`.

The file also includes a main method that should serve as an example
application of the module.  Run `utiltest.py` as a stand-alone program to see
how it works.
